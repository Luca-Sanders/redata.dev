## XML Parser

**SmartXML** is a ETL engine for parsing XML files with a wide range of features.

Example of work:
![](/smartxml/assets/images/xml2sql.png) 

The solution is well suited for both analysts and programmers working with XML on a regular basis.

## SmartXML allows:

*   Classify documents
*   Process documents with no fixed data schema
*   Flexibly configure the required set of fields for extraction
*   Generate SQL/JSON from XML (support PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ArangoDB)
*   Use built-in grammars (tiny NLP) for preprocessing data
*   And much more.
