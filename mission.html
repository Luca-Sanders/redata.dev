                    <p>
                        We struggle with the complexity of software products. Both external and internal. We strive to solve business problems not by bloating the code base, but by radically reducing
                        it. Our experience shows that re-engineering processes and moving away from hype technologies can reduce the size of a solution by hundreds, and the internal and external
                        complexity of a product by many times. As a result, in the long term, this allows us to radically reduce the costs of infrastructure, support, and maintenance of the solution.

                    <h1 style="font-weight: 700">Clouds are good, but data needs privacy</h1>

                    <p>
                        We value reproducibility and privacy. Therefore, we do not offer solutions that are not tied to our infrastructure. We make great efforts to combat the complexity of software
                        solutions, both external and internal.
